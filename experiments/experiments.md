### Say Hello to the BBC MicroBit ###

(Familiarising myself with the Microbit)

#### Reflection ####

In this experiment, I learnt what a Microbit is and learnt how to execute and display an image on the BBC using buttons on the microbit and saw how I could use the bread board to access these buttons externally using the supplied buttons. I also familiarised myself with the breadboard in this experiment as I had never used one before. I learnt how they are designed to work with through-hole electronic components to prototype an electronic circuit. As I am new to electronics, I found the breadbaord extremeely useful as the connections are not permanent, so it was easy to remove a component if I had made a mistake. I aslo familiarised myself with the Microsoft Makecode Editor. This was easy to use becasue of the drag and drop feature so it made it easier to understand the code that was being executed as part of the circuit.

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as (insert something here).
