(Familiarising myself with the Microbit)

#### Reflection ####

In this experiment, I learnt what a Microbit is and learnt how to execute and display an image on the BBC using buttons on the microbit and saw how I could use the bread board to access these buttons externally using the supplied buttons. I also familiarised myself with the breadboard in this experiment as I had never used one before. I learnt how they are designed to work with through-hole electronic components to prototype an electronic circuit. As I am new to electronics, I found the breadbaord extremeely useful as the connections are not permanent, so it was easy to remove a component if I had made a mistake. I aslo familiarised myself with the Microsoft Makecode Editor. This was easy to use becasue of the drag and drop feature so it made it easier to understand the code that was being executed as part of the circuit.

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as (insert something here).

Experimenting with a motor

#### Reflection ####777

In this experiment, I learnt about how fan motors are used on Microbits and how to control it's speed via a transistor. I observed that the motor after a few seconds started to spin slowly, then faster until it reached miximum speed, until at this point it slowed down and came to a stop then repeated the process. This also made me aware of the Duty Cycle diagram and how the volts changed at different speeds. During the experiment I learnt that if a transistor is turned on and off very quickly and it spends it's time on and half its time off then the fan motor will spin at half speed. So when I changed the parcentage of the time the transistor spends on, the speed of the motor could be finely controlled. I also learnt about the Pulse Width Modulations (PMW) process which explains how the widths of the pulses are controlled if the pulse is either on or off. Therefore, this means that the PWM varies the volatage and controls the speed of the fan motor.
