(Familiarising myself with the Microbit)

#### Reflection ####

In this experiment, I learnt what a Microbit is and learnt how to execute and display an image on the BBC using buttons on the microbit and saw how I could use the bread board to access these buttons externally using the supplied buttons. I also familiarised myself with the breadboard in this experiment as I had never used one before. I learnt how they are designed to work with through-hole electronic components to prototype an electronic circuit. As I am new to electronics, I found the breadbaord extremeely useful as the connections are not permanent, so it was easy to remove a component if I had made a mistake. I aslo familiarised myself with the Microsoft Makecode Editor. This was easy to use becasue of the drag and drop feature so it made it easier to understand the code that was being executed as part of the circuit.

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as children's toys- which require simple interactivity e.g. pressing a button to display a certain message. This experiment could also be the basis of real world application such as elevator buttons that display rhe level number or direction it is going in.

Experimenting with a motor

#### Reflection ####

In this experiment, I learnt about how fan motors are used on Microbits and how to control it's speed via a transistor. I observed that the motor after a few seconds started to spin slowly, then faster until it reached miximum speed, until at this point it slowed down and came to a stop then repeated the process. This also made me aware of the Duty Cycle diagram and how the volts changed at different speeds. During the experiment I learnt that if a transistor is turned on and off very quickly and it spends it's time on and half its time off then the fan motor will spin at half speed. So when I changed the parcentage of the time the transistor spends on, the speed of the motor could be finely controlled. I also learnt about the Pulse Width Modulations (PMW) process which explains how the widths of the pulses are controlled if the pulse is either on or off. Therefore, this means that the PWM varies the volatage and controls the speed of the fan motor. 

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as desk fans, commercial/industrial fans, drones and airplanes or any form of air transport. 



### Wind Power ###

#### Reflection ####

In this experiment, I had learnt about how voltage could be generated through kinetic energy. In this experiment I had to blow on the fan as seen above to spin the motor. The wind energy I conducted converted the kinetic energy of air into electrical power. I learnt that when an electrical current passes through the wire inside the, a torque was produced which is what turned the motor. The voltage that is created is then read by the Microbit and converted into a number between 0 and 1023. I tried blowing with different strengths on the fan to see how this would impact the voltage reading of the Microbit. When I pressed button A, the highest recorded value displayed on the screen.

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application to measure air velocity and air pressure in different locations or in systems. For example, this expeirment would be useful to understand how to check the performance of an air conditioning system as well as a ventilation system. 



### Making a Pedestrian Crossing ###

#### Reflection ####

In this experiment, I learnt the use of outputs, LEDS and a buzzer. I also learnt more functions within the MakeCode Editor including the 'repeat' loop, 'play tone' block and leanrt how to setup LED states outside of the main function loop. The experiment used all six outputs to create a traffic light and pedestrian crossing scenario. All outputs were controlled by a relatively simple sequence of Block commands and each command was followed by another. I found this experiment quite fun to see the leds follow a sequence, in the same way as a real-world traffic/pedestrian crossing scenario. 

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as an emergency vehicle or an alarm system that requires both output of light and sound.



### Making a Random Dice ###

#### Reflection ####

In this experiment, something new that I learnt was the use of the 'pick random' block to generate a random number in correlation with the output of 6 LEDS on the breadboard. Another interesting thing I learnt from this experiment was how the relationship between the number that is to be displayed on the dice, the LEDs that need to be lit up, and the pins that control them are all connected. Because there were so many wires on the breadboard, I had to make sure I inserted the wires in the correct place to complete the circuit. 

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application to play many games like snake ladder, Ludo etc. Generally dice is made up of wooden or plastic, which gets deformed with time and become biased. A Digital dice is a good alternative of old fashioned dice, it can't be biased or deformed.
